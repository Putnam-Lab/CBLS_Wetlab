<a name="Pre-Setup"></a> **Pre-Setup**
- For each coral being shipped you will need:
  - at least 12 rubber bands
  - two plastic shipping bags
  - one piece of styrofoam to float the coral
- take care to remove previous shipping labels and other information on shipping boxes
- be sure to schedule a Fedex Pickup at least 24 hours before ship date--Fedex typically comes to CBLS daily around 10:30-11am, but you should still schedule one just in case
- do **not** ship on Thursday or Friday as weekend complications may occur
- it is best to start packing corals around 8:30-9am
- try to avoid shipping corals in the summer--temperatures in the box can reach up to 52Â°C
  - if corals must be shipped in the summer corals can be shipped with an ice pack if they are traveling a short distance ie: URI to UPenn
- during winter months, corals can be shipped with a heat pack

1. Select corals from CBLS to ship and place them into a feeding bucket. ![](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/main/images/Coral-shipping/1-move-corals-from-tank.jpg)

2. Use a ceramic coral plug to bore a hole in the styrofoam fragment.

3. Place coral plug in hole--it should fit snuggly.

4. Use 2 rubber bands to hold coral in place. It is ok for rubber bands to touch the coral branches, but do not wrap the rubber band around the coral more than once, otherwise there is a risk of breaking off fragments.

5. Fill the bag about halfway with water.

6. Trap air inside the bag before tying the bag closed with rubber bands. It is essential that the bag is secure, so use at least 5 rubber bands to tie the first bag closed.

7. Place coral into a second bag in case the first bag bursts.It is essential that the bag is secure, so use at least 5 rubber bands to tie the second bag closed.

1. Minimize space within the shipping box. It is best to pack as many corals as possible per box, without compromising the space in the bag for the coral colonies.
  - If there is extra room in the box, you can fill a coral shipping bag with air or bubble wrap for extra padding.
  - If you are shipping with a heat or cold pack, wrap the heat or cold pack in a microfiber cloth to minimize the chances of the corals getting heat or cold burn.

2. Tape box on the interior to make sure the box is secure.

3. Tape box on the outside lengthwise, widthwise, and around the box to ensure that the box is secure.
