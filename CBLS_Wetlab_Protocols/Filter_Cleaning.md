The filtration bags are there to retain the impurities in the water (algae, suspended matter and other particles). It is important to change them every day in order to keep the filtration clean and to limit the accidents in case of it in the water.
# Materials:
- Bleach
- Water
- Water jet
- Filter

# Remove dirty filter from header tank and replace with a clean, dry filter/
1. Rinse dirty filter with water jet in the aquarium room to remove large particles.
2. Place dirty filter into a bucket located in the wet lab filled with 10% bleach. This bucket should be changed weekly.
3. After soaking for at least 24 hours, the filter should be white again.
4. Rinse with water jet to remove excess bleach.
5. Soak filter in a bucket filled with freshwater for at least 24 hours. Filter should not smell like anything.
6. Clean filters can be removed from the freshwater bucket and can drip dry on the faucet.
7. When clean filters are dry they can be stored with the washcloths back in the aquarium room.

*Important point: If rinsed improperly, bleach can unbalance the water quality of the aquarium and can lead to the death of organisms. Be careful when rinsing the bags and avoid contamination in the meantime with products such as soap, bleach, acid etc.*
