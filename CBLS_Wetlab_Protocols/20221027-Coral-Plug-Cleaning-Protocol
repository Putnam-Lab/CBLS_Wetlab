4. In cases where filamentous algae is found on the coral plugs, remove by simply pulling it off with the tip cutters or hand and dispose on a kim wipe. 
5. Take the toothbrush and brush along the top of the plug where the coral and the plug substrat meet to remove any algae. As you continue to brush the plug move to the sides, base and bottom of the plug until all or most of the algae has been brushed off. ![](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/main/images/Coral_Plug_Cleaning/cleaning-the-base-of-the-plug.jpg)
