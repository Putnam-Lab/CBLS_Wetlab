#Daily Wetlab Checklist
-
Details on daily tasks in the wetlab



*Daily Measurements*
-
- Using the Orion Salinity probe, Orion pH probe, and temperature probe take measurements of each blue tank (BT), header tank (HT), and Quarantine tank (QT). 
- Record all measurements on waterproof paper in binder.
- Record blue tanks as BT 1+2 and BT 3+4.
- Using DI water, carefully wash probe sensors. Avoid directly touching sensors especially on salinity probe. 
- Store probes in their respective solutions. 
    - pH probe in KCl 3M per liter of DI water
    - Salinity probe in DI water  

*Protein skimmer*
-
- Remove protein skimmer from its stand in the header tank and bring to sink to wash 
- Using course sponge, remove algae from top lid and main container
- Replace protein skimmer back in header tank 



*Sock filter change*
-
- Sock filters are generally stored inverted to dry by the sink 
- Grab a new dried sock filter and make sure it is not inside-out
- Bring to header tank and swap out with previous filter, attaching filter with bungee cord by going through the inner handle on filter and connecting by the bungee to itself with the two hooks.
- Wash used sock filter in sink making sure to remove as much alge as possible
- Place in first bucket of bleach and water mixture
- The following day, items in bleach bucket should be moved to the second bucket containing water
- For more infor refer to protocol below:
	- [Sock Filter Cleaning Protocol]

*Check DI RO System*
-
- Check to see how much DI water and salt water are in the large tanks
- If low, create time to fill DI water and do salt mixing, refer to protocol below
	- [Salt Mixing Protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/0491f7fb9fa878fd7c521b7e5143846c740b659e/CBLS_Wetlab_Protocols/Salt_Mixing_Protocol.md)

*Check Filters*
-
- Check sediment, carbon, resin filters as needed
- Replace filters as needed
- (Add protocol here)
