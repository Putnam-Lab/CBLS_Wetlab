## Fragmentation protocol

## Materials :
* Bone cutters
* Diamond saw
* Gloves
* Glue
* Labelled coral plugs
* egg crate
* Paper towels

## Methods:
1. Put on gloves to avoid any skin contact with the coral to minimize risk of bacterial transmission
2. Fragment corals with bone cutters
3. Fragment the pieces of the colony with the diamond saw.
4. Take the fragment and dry the foot of the cutting with a paper towel to facilitate the adhesion of the glue.
5. Use coral glue to adhere the coral fragment to a labeled plug
6. Let the fragment “dry” on a piece of egg crate to give the glue time to set.
7. After drying, return corals to the tank (time depending on the fragmented species).
8. NOTE: Between each different species cuttings, use 10% bleach, DI water, and an alcohol wipe to disinfect the material to avoid any bacterial transmission or other possible infection.
