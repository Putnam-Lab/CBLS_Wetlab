**PUTNAM LAB: WETLAB AQUARIUM INTRODUCTION AND SETUP**

**<a name="Introduction"></a> Introduction**

The Putnam Lab CBLS tanks are used for dynamic marine invertebrate projects facilitated by Putnam Lab members. The tanks offer a way for students to investigate methodology pertaining to research questions, monitor water quality, learn aquacultural techniques, and conduct vital research in marine invertebrate systems. 

To ensure accurate results, water quality is assessed within the tanks through various measurements that include; salinity, pH, and total alkalinity.

This manual serves as a baseline for lab members, interns, visiting scholars.

**<a name="Room_Layout_and_Equipment_Overview"></a> Room Layout and Equipment Overview**

When you enter the Aquarium Room, one side of the doors houses the tanks and storage area, while the other side is used by other labs for experimental work and includes a sink for freshwater use and everyday laundry tasks. 

The Putnam Lab features below tanks: 
1. DI (Deionized Water) Tank
2. Salt Mixing Tank
3. Header Tank
4. Blue Tanks (2)
5. Display Tank 

Here's a map to understand the setup better:

Other supporting equipments like the pumps, prime lights and filtration systems are an individual component of each tanks. Equipments currently not in use or in excess are stored either in the storage area in the aquarium space or in the loading dock storage room. If and when needed, the loading dock storage room could be accessed via a key present in the lab. If you do not know where you can find the loading dock storage, you can take a look at the map below.

For [Electrical]() and [Plumbing]() overview and troubleshooting take a look at the respective components for detailed information. 

**<a name="Tank_Descriptions_and_Designated_Uses"></a> Tank Descriptions and Designated Uses**

The system we acquire in the wetlab is a closed loop aquarium system wherein the water is circulated within our blue tanks and drawn originally from the source tank which is our header tank. 

**1. DI (Deionized) Tank**
- One of the main uses of the DI tank is to supply water for salt mixing, especially during the initial setup phase.
- This tank is connected to both the mixing tank as well as the header tank by pumps and valves. 
- Before the DI water enters either of the tanks, it goes through a complex filtering system. 

    
**2. Salt Mixing Tank/Mixing Tank**
- The salt mixing tank is used to make the salt water. We do not source our salt water into the system from anywhere but instead make it by ourself using the FritzProMax Salt along with the DI water present in the DI tank. 
- For information about making the saltwater take look at the [salt mixing protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/a76b1daa0496a1519f671ba8c47e95aadaaa959f/CBLS_Wetlab_Protocols/Salt_Mixing_Protocol.md).
- The mixing tanks is connected to both, the header and DI tank through pumps that open through the valves.

  **Make sure you always check the salinity of the mixing tank and the other tank that you want to add the saltwater into. If the salinity of mixing tank is >35.3 psu, add some DI to the mixing tank and let it mix for some time and take a reading for the salinity of the tank after two-three hours.**  


**3. Header Tank**

The header tank is a rectangular black tank placed on the ground in our aquarium room, that serves to supply water and acts as a reservoir for replenishing water lost to evaporation or used in the system and helps maintain a stable water level. 

The water always firsts enter the header tank, after the desired salinity is obtained in the mixing tank which is then ready to use for the blue tanks. 

The header tank is the only tank which is dosed by different components like the alkanity reagent, calcium, nitrogen, phosphorous as well as DI which is then circulated through our closed-loop aquarium systems.

The header tank has two additonal components like the protein skimmer and the sock filter. The Protein Skimmer is a filteration device needed to get rid of the dissolved organic compounds present in the water. The sock filter takes out the debris and big particles thus also filtering the system. 

**4. Blue Tanks**

In the wetlab, the tanks which houses the marine invertebrates are these two big blue rectangular tanks which are divided into the blue tanks 1, 2, 3 and 4. Each blue tank had additional components like the pumps, apex probes which measures the salinity, temperature and the pH.

The blue tanks houses the corals which needs regular feeding and maintenance. The corals are fed every week and the tanks are cleaned along with the corals.

Note: For more information about the tanks, its working, cleaning and troubleshooting look [here](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/a1f1c11a7e67a65b3d51d5bcb837b07c02263785/CBLS_Wetlab_Protocols/CBLS-Tank-Systems-Information.md)
 
 **5. Display Tank**
 
 In addition to all the major tanks, a small display tank has been installed for educational and outreach purposes. Among all of the tanks, only the blue tanks and the display tank currently house marine invertebrates.

**<a name="Water_Quality_Testing_and_Maintenance_Protocols"></a> Water Quality Testing and Maintenance Protocols**

We use various ways to test the quality of the water in our systems and different tanks. 

In general, everyday we take daily measurements of the header and blue tanks to check if the expected quality is attained. For that, we take measurements like salinity, temperature and pH. 
To know the process of taking the daily measurements go through [this](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/b128631f6e7346a03ac953c6fcd9b4f6b916bc6f/CBLS_Wetlab_Protocols/DailyWetlabChecklist_Protocols.md) protocol.

Additionally, there are extra test kits to test the levels of nutrients and other parameters which can be utilized as a resource to cross reference the probes or protocols which we test in the lab.


**<a name="Access_and_Control_to_the_Wetlab"></a> Access and Control to the Wetlab**

The aquarium room is located on basement floor closer to the loading dock in Room 70. Access to the Aquarium Room requires a key, which can be found in the PPP Research Lab (Rooms 188 and 190). The key is located on the cabinets positioned at the center of the seating area. 

In order to have access to the PPP lab and loading dock please contact Hollie Putnam at hputnam@uri.edu for assistance. 

*Please note: There are two keys in the PPP lab for accessing the aquarium room. Kindly only use Putnam Lab assigned key for access and make sure to return it back at the end of the day.*


**<a name="Safety_Guidelines_and_Emergency_Procedures"></a> Safety Guidelines and Emergency Procedures**

Every member of the lab goes through the lab safety training before starting to work in the lab. The information about the trainings could be found [here](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/wiki/Lab-Safety) and additonal information about the laboratory resources [here](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/wiki/Laboratory-Resources).

**<a name="Preparing_tanks_for_usage:_DI_and_Salt_Mixing_Procedures"></a> Preparing tanks for usage: DI and Salt Mixing Procedures**

In order to carry out any experiments or managing the aquarium systems, always make sure before that there is DI and saltwater avaliable for your use and some reserve. If you think, the avaliable reserve is not sufficient, please reach out to the person managing the wetlab if you are not sure about the working of the tanks. If you have been trained on that, you can go through the [tank information](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/a1f1c11a7e67a65b3d51d5bcb837b07c02263785/CBLS_Wetlab_Protocols/CBLS-Tank-Systems-Information.md) and [salt mixing protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/a76b1daa0496a1519f671ba8c47e95aadaaa959f/CBLS_Wetlab_Protocols/Salt_Mixing_Protocol.md) to proceed.
