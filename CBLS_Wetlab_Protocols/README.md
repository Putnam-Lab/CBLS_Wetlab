The Putnam Lab CBLS tanks are used for dynamic marine invertebrate projects facilitated by Putnam Lab members. The tanks offer a way for students to investigate methodology pertaining to research questions, monitor water quality, learn aquacultural techniques, and conduct vital research in marine invertebrate systems. 

To ensure accurate results, water quality is assessed within the tanks through various measurements that include; salinity, pH, total alkalinity, calcium, and carbonate hardness. Environmental parameters, such as, temperature, light, NH4, NO2, NO3, and PO4 are also measured.
