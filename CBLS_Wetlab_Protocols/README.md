**PUTNAM LAB: WETLAB AQUARIUM INTRODUCTION AND SETUP**

**<a name="Introduction"></a> Introduction**

The Putnam Lab CBLS tanks are used for dynamic marine invertebrate projects facilitated by Putnam Lab members. The tanks offer a way for students to investigate methodology pertaining to research questions, monitor water quality, learn aquacultural techniques, and conduct vital research in marine invertebrate systems. 

To ensure accurate results, water quality is assessed within the tanks through various measurements that include; salinity, pH, and total alkalinity.

This manual serves as a baseline for lab members, interns, visiting scholars.

**<a name="Room_Layout_and_Equipment_Overview"></a> Room Layout and Equipment Overview**

When you enter the Aquarium Room, one side of the doors houses the tanks and storage area, while the other side is used by other labs for experimental work and includes a sink for freshwater use and everyday laundry tasks. 

The Putnam Lab features below tanks: 
1. DI (Deionized Water) Tank
2. Salt Mixing Tank
3. Header Tank
4. Blue Tanks (2)
5. Display Tank 

Here's a map to understand the setup better:

Other supporting equipments like the pumps, prime lights and filtration systems are an individual component of each tanks. Equipments currently not in use or in excess are stored either in the storage area in the aquarium space or in the loading dock storage room. If and when needed, the loading dock storage room could be accessed via a key present in the lab. If you do not know where you can find the loading dock storage, you can take a look at the map below.

For [Electrical]() and [Plumbing]() overview and troubleshooting take a look at the respective components for detailed information. 

**<a name="Tank_Descriptions_and_Designated_Uses"></a> Tank Descriptions and Designated Uses**

**1. DI (Deionized) Tank**
- One of the main uses of the DI tank is to supply water for salt mixing, especially during the initial setup phase.
- This tank is connected to both the mixing tank as well as the header tank by pumps and valves. 
- Before the DI water enters either of the tanks, it goes through a complex filtering system. 

Note: For more information about the cleaning, working and troubleshooting of the DI Tank System look [here](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/a1f1c11a7e67a65b3d51d5bcb837b07c02263785/CBLS_Wetlab_Protocols/CBLS-Tank-Systems-Information.md)
    
**2. Salt Mixing Tank/Mixing Tank**
- The salt mixing tank is used to make the salt water. We do not source our salt water into the system from anywhere but instead make it by ourself using the FritzProMax Salt along with the DI water present in the DI tank. 
- For information about making the saltwater take look at the [salt mixing protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/a76b1daa0496a1519f671ba8c47e95aadaaa959f/CBLS_Wetlab_Protocols/Salt_Mixing_Protocol.md).
- The mixing tanks is connected to both, the header and DI tank through pumps that open through the valves.s

  **Make sure you always check the salinity of the mixing tank and the other tank that you want to add the saltwater into. If the salinity of mixing tank is >35.5 psu look at the troubleshooting information in the link below.**  

Note: For more information about the working and troubleshooting of the Mixing Tank System look [here](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/a1f1c11a7e67a65b3d51d5bcb837b07c02263785/CBLS_Wetlab_Protocols/CBLS-Tank-Systems-Information.md)


**3. Header Tank**

**4. Blue Tanks**
 
 **5. Display Tank**
 
 In addition, a small display tank has been installed for educational and outreach purposes. Among these, only the blue tanks and the display tank currently house marine invertebrates, primarily corals.

The aquarium room is located on basement floor closer to the loading dock in Room 70. Access to the Aquarium Room requires a key, which can be found in the PPP Research Lab (Rooms 188 and 190). The key is located on the cabinets positioned at the center of the seating area. 

In order to have access to the PPP lab and loading dock please contact Hollie Putnam at hputnam@uri.edu for assistance. 

*Please note: There are two keys in the PPP lab for accessing the aquarium room. Kindly only use Putnam Lab assigned key for access and make sure to return it back at the end of the day.*
