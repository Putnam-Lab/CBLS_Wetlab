# Protocol for making coral plugs from concrete

## Necessary materials:
-       Cement
-       Water
-       Sand

## Methods :
1. Mix the cement with water (proportion: 2/3 cement 1/3 water).
2. Pour the mixture into concrete molds.
3. Wait a few hours for the cement to set.
4. Once the cement has hardened slightly, place sand on the surface of the coral plug (still in the molds) to facilitate the adhesion of the glue to the stud.
5. Once the sand has been put in, wait 24 hours for the cement/sand to set completely and then remove the whole thing from the mold.
6. Important point: Considering the composition of the pads and in order to avoid the release of CaCO3 (increase of pH) in the closed circuits, it is necessary to soak them in a mixture of fresh water / sea water for a few weeks.
