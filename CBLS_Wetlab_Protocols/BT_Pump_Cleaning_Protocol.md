- container of freshwater

<a name="Remove-Pump"></a> **Remove Pump From Tank**
1. Turn off the pump at the power strip under BT3/4

2. Locate the cord attached to the outlet you turned off, and unplug the pump cord (with the controller box) from the power cord

3. Keep the controller box dry as you pull it out from under the tanks

4. Remove the dirty pump from the tank, making sure to keep the magnet from the outside of the tank in a safe place, they drop and get lost easily.
   1. KEEP THE CONTROLLER DRY!

5. Place the pump into a plastic bin to transport it to the table to clean it

<a name="Cleaning-Orbit"></a> **Cleaning Orbit Pumps (long cylinder pump)**
1. Pull off the black guards from the central assembly

2. Pull off the blue rotors from the central assembly
   1. ![](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/main/images/Pump_cleaning/rotors.jpeg)
3. Clean ALL parts with a toothbrush/cloth and freshwater
   1. ![](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/main/images/Pump_cleaning/clean1.jpeg)
4. Once scrubbed, bring the bin to the sink and rinse all parts thoroughly with freshwater
   1. KEEP THE CONTROLLER DRY!
   2. ![](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/main/images/Pump_cleaning/clean2.jpeg)
5. Reassemble the pump, making sure the GREEN rotor goes into the GREEN side of the motor, and the RED goes into the RED

   2. ![](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/main/images/Pump_cleaning/orbit_clean2.jpeg)
6. Follow the **"Remove Pump From Tank"** steps in reverse to put the clean pump back
   1. Make sure your hands and all cords are completely dry before plugging the controller back in. 
      1. IF THE CONTROLLER GOT WET, wait for it to fully dry (several hours) before plugging it in, otherwise the pump will short circuit


<a name="Cleaning-Nero"></a> **Cleaning Nero Pumps (circle pumps)**
1. Remove the front black cover from the pump (twist off)
   1. ![](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/main/images/Pump_cleaning/nero_dirty1.jpeg)
2. Pull the blue rotor from the central assembly
   1. ![](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/main/images/Pump_cleaning/nero_dirty2.jpeg)
3. Remove the back black cover from the pump (attached via magnet)
   1. ![](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/main/images/Pump_cleaning/nero5_guard_assembly.png)
4. Clean ALL parts with a toothbrush/cloth and freshwater
   1. ![](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/main/images/Pump_cleaning/nero_dirty3.jpeg)
   2. Pay *extra attention* to any white calcium buildup on the blue rotor and motor - this needs to be cleaned really well
5. Once scrubbed, bring the bin to the sink and rinse all parts thoroughly with freshwater
   1. KEEP THE CONTROLLER DRY!
   2. ![](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/CBLS_Wetlab/blob/main/images/Pump_cleaning/nero_clean.jpeg)
6. Reassemble the pump, following the reverse steps from above
