### Standard Operating Procedure: Electrical Trip Response and Troubleshooting


The aquarium room relies on continuous electrical supply to run pumps, filters, and other life-support systems. Water drips or leaks from tanks can cause power interruptions or electrical trips, creating safety hazards and threatening animal welfare. This protocol outlines the steps to safely respond and restore normal operations.

There are various possible reasons for the trip either through water dripping between the cracks while cleanup or water splashes on the electrical boxes/circuits directly. 

While you are following the steps assess any possible reasons and be vigilant about your surroundings. 

#### STEP 1: Assess the Environment and ensure your Safety
   - Do not **PANIC** and make sure you are safe. 
   - Stop your work immediately, clear the area and do not attempt to touch outlets, equipments with your wet hands or if the outlets/equipments are wet itself. 
   - Notify your lab manager or supervisor about the same. 
   - *If you see smoke, sparks inform the building manager, your PI and incase of serious emergency call 911.*
   - **Dry your hands nicely before proceeding to next steps.**

#### STEP 2: Isolate Power if safe

  - After your hands are completely dried, take off the two main power plugs which is black and tan colored from the electrical socket in the wall opposite blue tanks 3/4 near the storage racks. *This will ensure that power to the aquarium system is completely off*.

  - Now make sure that the black switch board below the blue tank 3/4 is dry, if not, wipe it off with towels and turn off all the switches which corresponds to the lights and the pumps. If you are unsure about anything, do not proceed to troubleshooting anything by yourself and reach out to your supervisors for help. 

  - **Do not unplug any equipments, electrical components, wires except the main plugs that we dettached from the power outlet at the start.**
  
#### STEP 3: Assess the tanks and life support systems
 
 - Once you proceed to this step, now make visual assessment of the organisms in the tank and note down any concerning signs. 

 - *Note: The header tank can fill in to its maximum capacity or until the water level is lower than the outlet pumps. If required and incase of overflowing (which is extremely rare), you can take some water out from the header tank in storage containers avaliable in the lab. This would unable there is no additional spill on the floor and closer to any outlets to further escalate the situation.* 

 - As our tanks are dependent upon the pumps and lights for effective temperature maintenance, make sure to keep the cover lids closed to further stop heat loss until you troubleshoot completely and get the system back running.

#### STEP 4: Clean up for leaks

 - Any water leaks if noticed or larger spills, contain and collect the drip or leaks with the help of avaliable bins and wipe off any access water with the help of adsorbent towels and avaliable laundry. 

 - If any of the equipment or system component is compromised in this incidence, make sure to take a note and mark it with the help of tape.
 
#### STEP 5: Reset and testing



#### STEP 6: Report it in the notebook
