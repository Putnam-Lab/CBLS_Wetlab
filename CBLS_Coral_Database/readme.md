### Shipment and coral fragment notes

#### 1st shipment from Hawaii arrived on 20210618

- 1st shipment included unlabeled *Montipora capitata* fragments and 5-7 unlabeled plugs potentially with juveniles on them.  
- These were placed in the water table upon arrival but had significant tissue fall off the fragments which clogged up the water table and caused a bad smell.  
- Fragments were placed in a quarantine tank and recovered a little bit, gaining some color back. They were held there for a couple more days until the tank was needed for the 2nd shipment. They were then placed back into the water table and have been stable since.  
- Fragments were glued to plugs on 20210716 and 20210717, and labeled on 20210717 and 20210719.  
- The plugs are unlabeled.  
- Images of a subset of corals (first taken on 20210719), are found in the lab google drive images folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1g1UQAQpicxsuLb_QoF_4cuvAucUm6p_r).
- A lot of the corals started to look pale on Monday 20210726, but we don't know why. They were fed the Thursday before (20210722) and looked fine then. The only thing I (Alison) can think of that happened around that time is the dead *M capitatas* and *P. acutas* were removed on 20210721 or 22, maybe leaving mucus or tissue? Pictures from 20210727 are in the above google folder.

#### 2nd shipment from Hawaii arrived on 20210630

- 2nd shipment included labeled *Montipora capitata* fragments from the HI Bleaching Pairs project, unlabeled juveniles on plug, and unlabeled extra fragments from the water tables Ariana and Hollie monitored in Hawaii in June 2021.  
- Shipment arrived on Wednesday, corals were placed in small quarantine tanks and glued to plugs on Friday.  
- HI Bleaching pairs and unknown extra fragments were glued to clear plastic plugs that have a 4 digit ID etched on them.  
- By the next Tuesday (20210706), all the 2nd shipment fragments had a thin white tissue filament covering their tissue. We're not sure what this is, but looks like some sort of disease? Emma saw this a couple of times in her tanks in Hawaii in 2018 but we weren't sure what it was.  
- Upon further inspection of the white gunk, it seems to be a mucus like membrane that is white and thin, it feels like the skin on a boiled egg, directly under the shell. It is also slimy and it smells of sulfur.  
- All but 4 U's have been saved/ aren't affected. Almost all M's are affected. They all have severe cases of tissue malfunction or are developing it quickly
